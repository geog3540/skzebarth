      <h5 style="color: rgb(0, 47, 255);"><u>Background & Goal:</u></h5>
      <br>
      <p>Harmful algal blooms (HABs) have been increasingly present in Iowa lakes, 
        which in turn threatens drinking water availability and state income through recreational opportunities. 
        Given that HABs can produce microcystin, a toxin that can cause liver and kidney failure and cancer, there 
        is an increased human health risk (Gu et al., 2022; US EPA, 2013). Current projections suggest that HAB
        events will increase with warming temperatures, and 2023 was a record-breaking year for HAB advisories in Iowa 
        (Gu et al., 2022; US EPA, 2013). Currently, in Iowa, 39 state-owned beaches are monitored by water sampling once a week, 
        limiting the capacity to make informed risk assessments across the state throughout the summer. 
        Environmental groups have stated that increased monitoring is needed to limit human exposure (IDNR, 2022; Peikes, 2021; Schechinger, 2021), 
        but budget constraints limit the ability to increase monitoring across more lakes. 
        There is a critical need to lower costs and time while improving our capacity for detecting and managing HAB dynamics across time and space.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Satellite remote sensing has been leveraged worldwide for rapid HAB assessment,
           capturing HAB spatial and temporal variability at a rate that is impossible with in-situ techniques. 
           Furthermore, the annual mean cost savings of a satellite platform for retrieval of chlorophyll-a alone 
           has been estimated to be $42 million a year (Papenfus et al., 2020). However, current work targets large 
           freshwater lakes (e.g., Lake Erie) or oceans (e.g., Florida coast), which is not translatable to the smaller 
           freshwater lakes common in Iowa and the Midwest because of the need to capture near-shore HABs 
           (Binding et al., 2021; Hill et al., 2020). Inland waters are also optically complex systems in comparison to 
           coastal and ocean monitoring, making established techniques non-transferable. This research expands the use of 
           satellite remote sensing for detecting, assessing, and monitoring HABs in freshwater inland lakes with a focus 
           on generating a near-daily product that could inform public health initiatives. We will develop a remote sensing 
           methodology that fuses imagery from multiple satellite sensors, enhancing our capability to monitor HABs almost 
           daily across a lake. This multi-sensor approach equips Iowa water managers with the spatio-temporal trends that 
           can provide insight into the dynamics of HABs. However, to complete this overarching aim in future research, 
          we must first assess the capacities of a suite of satellites in retrieving chlorophyll-a. </p>
          <p style="text-indent: 50px;"><b>Here, I use satellite remote sensing to predict chlorophyll-a in Big Spirit Lake 
            in Iowa with PlanetScope, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-3 for a 9/11/2023 to answer the following questions:</b></p>
            <ol>
              <li>What spatial/spectral resolution of the proposed instruments is most appropriate for capturing the spatial variability of HABS?</li>
              <li>Which instrument has the highest pixel and interpolated pixel correlation between field-verified chlorophyll-a and remotely sensed chlorophyll-a?</li>
            </ol>

      <h5 style="color: rgb(0, 47, 255);"><u>Data Collection & Methods:</u></h5>
      <br>

      
      <h6 style="text-indent: 50px;"><i>Study Site, In-situ Data, & HAB Distribution Comparison:</i></h6>
      <br>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="container">
            <img class="card-img-top" src="images/merged_symbols_legend.png" alt="">
            <p class="card-text text-center">(Figure 1. Study sample locations are on Big Spirit Lake, Iowa. 
              The chlorophyll-a value is shown using a graduated symbol approach with a Jenks-natural breaks classification. 
              These points and values were used to create the inverse distance-weighted product.)</p>
       </div>
      </div><br>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px;">The study site for this project is Big Spirit Lake, located in Orleans in northwest Iowa. 
        Big Spirit Lake was selected as it is the largest body of water in the state of Iowa and is a major 
        recreation site for Iowans that also experience late summer algal blooms. 
        The presence of microcystin is the main concern for public health, but microcystin does not possess 
        a spectral or optical signature that remote sensing can measure. Therefore, proxies such as chlorophyll-a 
        and phycocyanin are used to monitor microcystin concentrations, as they have been shown to correlate with 
        microcystin toxin presence (Buley et al., 2022; Marion et al., 2012). Chlorophyll-a is a pigment in algae that
        photosynthesizes sunlight into organic compounds and is a commonly applied measure of water's eutrophic condition as 
        algae biomass grows (Zhang et al., 2017). However, chlorophyll-a is not a perfect measure of HAB risk, as it is present
         in many algal species that do not produce toxins (Ogashawara, 2020). Phycocyanin, a secondary pigment 
         found in HAB species such as Microcystin aeruginosa, has been the target for many recent studies as it 
         provides the capacity to distinguish toxin-producing algal species. </p>
         <p style="text-indent: 50px;">We conducted four field campaigns 
          in Big Spirit lake through the 2023 season to gather the in-situ chlorophyll-a lab-verified values needed 
          for future empirically-driven machine-learning approaches. Data assessed here is from campaign four on 9/11/2023.
           Each campaign used a small boat to collect 40 water samples following State Hygenic Lab (SHL) protocol. 
           Study site sampling points are approximately 700 meters from one another and were created to align with 
           the raster pixels of overpassing satellites (Figure 1). At each collection site, sub-centimeter resolution Global navigation 
           satellite system (GNSS) locations were taken with a Trimble DA2 at each site to identify corresponding imagery pixels. 
           The in-situ values collected on 9/11/2023 had chlorophyll-a values verified via the SHL. 
         These values will be point-based data used to verify pixel values from the remotely sensed data. 
         These pixel point values were also used to generate an Inverse Distance-Weighted (IDW) raster in ArcGIS Pro &copy;ESRI. 
         The IDW product has a pixel size equal to the platform its compared against 
         (PlanetScope: IDW 3m, Sentinel-2: IDW 20m, Sentinel-3: IDW 300m) for a fair comparison of in-situ predicted to remotely sensed HAB distribution.   </p>

            <p class="card-text text-center">(Figure 2. In Sept. 2023, Big Spirit Lake in NW Iowa had a HAB that was imaged with PlanetScope (~3m pixel size),
               Sentinel-2 (20m), and Sentinel-3 (300m) sensors. 
              Inset shows Orleans Beach. While daily imagery is critical for monitoring, Sentinel-3 limits the ability to capture near-shore HABs.)</p>
       </div>
      </div><br>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Three sensors are used in this project, as they have varying spatial resolutions and band placements.
        Sentinel-2, with a revisit time of 5 days and spatial resolution of 20 meters, has been used in recent HAB analysis (Beal et al., 2024). 
        Sentinel-3 was designed for water applications, but specifically for ocean watercolor, so it collects imagery approximately daily but with 
        300 m spatial resolution (Donlon et al., 2012). The PlanetScope SuperDove satellite constellation has a nearly daily revisit time and a 
        spatial resolution of 3 m but remains untested as data has only recently become available to the public. These remote sensing platforms were 
        selected for their synergistic capabilities: Sentinel-2's moderate spatial resolution and more appropriate spectral bands, Sentinel-3's 
        frequent revisits and ideal spectral bands, and PlanetScope's high spatial and temporal resolution (Figure 2). 
        Sentinel data is freely available from the <a href="https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/">Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem</a>&copy;, 
        and PlanetScope data from <a href="https://www.planet.com/explorer/">Planet Explorer</a>&copy;.</p>
      <br>
      <h6 style="text-indent: 50px;"><i>Predicting Chlorophyll-a:</i></h6>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px;">In the future, we plan on assessing more spectral indices, a multiple-instance learning algorithm, 
        and a random forest machine learning approach. However, this project assesses the Normalized Difference Chlorophyll Index (NDCI). 
        The NDCI uses the red-edge (centered 705 nm, 15nm Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM)) and red (centered 665nm, 30 nm FWHM)  bands 
        available on the Sentinel-2 (Eq. 1), as these bands have been shown to strongly correlate to chlorophyll-a (Caballero et al., 2020). 
        Planetscope has spectrally coincident bands, both in location and bandwidth, allowing for a 1-1 comparison of the resulting NDCI product. 
        However, Sentinel-3 uses bands 08 (centered 665 nm, 10nm FWHM) and 11 (centered 708.75 nm, 10nm FWHM) to produce the resulting NDCI product.
        The resulting product values can only exist on a scale from -1 to positive 1, where positive values demonstrate increasing chlorophyll-a abundance;
         however, extremely high and low values can also indicate clouds and cloud shadows. </p>

    <br>
    <h6 style="text-indent: 50px;"><i>Targeted Audience, Visualization Objectives, & Workflow:</i></h6>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Eventually, this work will be used to build a HAB dashboard for the State of Iowa, 
        which will alleviate the demand upon agencies to increase water quality testing without increasing spending. 
        Therefore, the ultimate audience is water quality managers in Iowa. However, established satellite remote sensing methodologies, 
        such as using NDCI to measure current water quality, have yet to be tested in Iowa. To build this eventual HAB dashboard, 
        we must first determine what available instruments will be most helpful in achieving our ultimate goal. 
        This project aims to resolve this by answering research questions 1 and 2, which ultimately makes the audience of this research 
        the members of the Lab for Observing and Quantifying Aquatic and Terrestrial Ecosystems (LOQATE). 
        The LOQATE lab needs this first step completed before any further research can commence. </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px;">The primary visualization objective of this work is to compare the distributions of remotely sensed 
        HAB products to an in-situ point-based IDW product. The rationale behind this decision is to clarify the underlying remotely sensed data 
        if poor correlations are present; ergo, if NDCI performs poorly, having a visual distribution comparison helps us understand where 
        performance is low and gives insights into why. Furthermore, it also allows general comparisons to be made given the inherent temporal 
        limitation of this research; a remotely sensed image is a snapshot of the whole-lake water quality conditions, while the in-situ point 
        data is collected for two to three hours via boat. If visual comparisons of the 
        IDW and remotely sensed chlorophyll-a disagree/make visual sense, that may provide valuable information regarding sampling methodology.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">The ultimate coding objective is determining the most successful chlorophyll-a retrieval from satellite 
          remote-sensing products. Answering research question two is accomplished in two ways: pulling the NDCI value from the nearest pixel 
          to the in-situ point data and interpolating a value from all pixels near the point-based data. Ultimately, two heavily refactored programs 
          from seven original programs were developed to complete this project's methodology and workflow and answer the research questions (Figure 3). 
          A secondary objective in the figures generated by this work was to make the scales comparable between the varying IDW and remote sensing products; 
          therefore, a function was developed to normalize all products for all resulting figures.</p>

      <h6 style="text-indent: 50px;"><i>PlanetScope:</i></h6>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Comparing the spatial patterns between the 3-meter IDW raster and the 3-meter NDCI product from PlanetScope 
        is challenging due to the cutoff occurring down the right side of Big Spirit Lake (Figure 4, middle section). This large no-data clip is
         present because the PlanetScope satellites operate as constellation products, which means that errors can occur when capturing a full scene. 
         In this case, the following satellite did not capture the correct extent to mosaic the imagery perfectly, cutting off what is arguably one 
         of the most important parts of the raster to compare, as this is where the IDW has its most significant variance. Furthermore, the PlanetScope
          NDCI, when the scale is corrected to show more variability, still exhibits a large amount of noise. Nevertheless, some spatial patterns/variances 
          are present, particularly the northwest portions of the IDW and PlanetScope NDCI, which follow similar generalizable patterns (i.e., 
          There is a high band of NDCI that wraps around a slight dip of lower NDCI values; this also occurs in the westernmost section); however,
           this becomes less and less true the more southeast you are in the image. More interesting is the northeastern portion of the IDW and 
           planetscope imagery; these locations do not agree regarding chlorophyll-a levels. This is where the point data noted its highest chlorophyll-a 
           levels, but on the NDCI imagery, the levels are reporting lower than the western portion of the imagery. After reviewing the histogram of 
           NDCI values across the lake, we found that the range of values for PlanetScope (0.0 - 0.52) was the second highest of the three satellites 
           observed. It follows a normal distribution with a slight skew towards higher NDCI values. Finally, the pixel correlation is the second highest
            of the three instruments, presenting a slightly negative correlation between in-situ chlorophyll-a and pixel values, 
        with the closest pixel values (R^2 = 0.032, p = 0.374) performing lower than using interpolated pixels (R^2 = 0.065, p = 0.199) (Figure 5).  </p>

    <br>
    <h6 style="text-indent: 50px;"><i>Sentinel-2:</i></h6>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px;">In general, Sentinel-2 performed the poorest among all satellites assessed (Figure 6). 
        Complete data is available for the Sentinel-2 platform, and in visually examining its NDCI product and relative IDW across the lake, 
        there are a few patterns worth noting. First, the Sentinel-2 NDCI correctly identifies the northeast cutout as having the highest 
        chlorophyll-a values, and generally follows the correct patterns with the middle-southeast dip in chlorophyll-a. However, almost every 
        portion of the western and southern NCDI does not follow spatial distributions similar to those of the IDW. Extreme NCDI values are present 
        along the outskirts of most of the northeastern portion of Big Spirit Lake, which is noteworthy because this is not seen in PlanetScope imagery 
        with coincident bands. The range of NDCI values (0.01 - 0.27) is the lowest among all three platforms and, similar to PlanetScope, is more 
        normally distributed with a skew towards higher NDCI values. Also present in this imagery are clouds, which report very low NDCI values that impact 
        the satellite's success rate; the pixel correlation is the second highest of the three instruments, presenting a very slight negative correlation 
        between in-situ chlorophyll-a and pixel values, with the closest pixel values (R^2 = 0.003, p = 0.740) performing lower than using interpolated pixels 
        (R^2 = 0.004, p = 0.703) (Figure 7). There is no relationship between Sentinel-2's remotely sensed NDCI product and lab-verified chlorophyll-a; even 
        masking for cloud values does not improve the NDCI values to a statistically significant point and does not perform better than PlanetScope or Sentinel-3 data.

    <h6 style="text-indent: 50px;"><i>Sentinel-3:</i></h6>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Sentinel-3 was the highest-performing satellite in retrieving chlorophyll-a from Big Spirit Lake. 
        Nearly complete data is available for the Sentinel-3 platform, as the product is delivered to the user with a land mask built into the raster, 
        which generates extreme values. These values are masked in the final product, creating missing pixels in the final NDCI raster (Figure 8).
         Visually examining the Sentinel-3 NDCI product and its relative IDW across Big Spirit Lake is more generalizable due to the IDW and Sentinel-3 
         spatial resolutions of 300m. Overall, the Sentinel-3 imagery appropriately detects general zones of high chlorophyll-a, and as the IDW product, 
         does lower towards the middle/southeast. However, they do not lower at similar rates, even when normalized. The range of Sentinel-3 values is the 
         highest (-1 to 1) and is seminormal/minorly bimodal. While this geovisualization course taught that the NDCI colormap should be a diverging color 
         scheme because of its normalized scale with a meaningful zero point, above 99% of all of the data for all three satellites is positive, which makes 
         a continuous color scheme more appropriate for seeing the NDCI distributions. Finally, Sentinel-3 pixel correlation is the highest of all instruments, 
         presenting a slight positive correlation between in-situ chlorophyll-a and pixel values, with the closest pixel values (R^2 = 0.167, p = 0.053)
         performing better than using interpolated pixels (R^2 = 0.062, p = 0.253) (Figure 9). There is a very slight relationship between Sentinel-3's remotely 
         sensed NDCI product and lab-verified chlorophyll-a.</p>

    <h6 style="text-indent: 50px;"><i>Considering Spectral & Spatial Resolution:</i></h6>
    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Before I began this work, I was confident that Sentinel-3 would perform the poorest among the three in both research questions. 
      Its course spatial resolution would limit its capacity to capture the dynamic nature of HABs, and by integrating the spectral signature over such a larger 
      area than PlanetScope and Sentinel-2, I assumed that its NDCI product would not correlate. However, the results prove the opposite, but what is interesting 
      is that the Sentinel-3 NDCI did not follow the same trend where interpolating point values improved correlation. This makes sense given that the interpolation 
      uses pixels that are 300 meters, which means that after a specific spatial resolution, interpolating pixel values is unnecessary. However, when working with 
      instruments that have a higher spatial resolution, it is better to interpolate values from nearby pixels to improve the retrieval of chlorophyll-a values. 
      This is a valuable result to consider, as it may also be true when training a machine-learning dataset that uses all key spectral bands. </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px;">The success of Sentinel-3 demonstrates that spectral resolution is crucial, and smaller bandwidths and improved band locations 
        are essential in the accurate retrieval of chlorophyll-a in Big Spirit Lake. Consider the spectral differences between Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3; the band 
        centers used are close/identical, but the bandwidths are very different. The red band for both Copernicus platforms is centered on 665 nm, but Sentinel-2 
        has an FWHM of 30 nm while Sentinel-3's is only 10 nm. For the red edge band, Sentinel-2 is centered at 705 nm with an FWHM of 15 nm, while Sentinel-3 is 
        centered at 708.75 nm with an FWHM of 10 nm. The necessary chlorophyll-a spectral signatures that the bands of each instrument are targeting, a prominent 
        absorption feature near 660 nm and high reflectance around 705 nm, are very small, meaning the larger bandwidths may not effectively capture chlorophyll-a. 
        Secondly, Other spectrally active parameters, such as colored dissolved organic material and sediment, may be affecting the spectral signature, particularly 
        given that Big Spirit Lake is very shallow. But this is not the full story, as plenty of research demonstrates Sentinel-2 with substantially improved results 
        than what is delivered here, 
        but for Iowa lakes, other well-developed research methodologies may not be applicable. </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">The best evidence that higher spatial resolution does have importance is that PlanetScope performed substantially better with 
          the same band centers and bandwidths. Initially, I considered this to be a temporal effect, which after consideration is unlikely to be the case as only 
          20 minutes passed between PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 time of capture. What is likely causing this large disparity is that clouds are influencing Sentinel-2 
          and that Planetscope can capture more spatial variability of HAB conditions. Nevertheless, what ultimately becomes clear is that the NDCI is not a 
          particularly useful index to use over Big Spirit Lake. In the future, cloud masking from code will be implemented into this work, and more spectral indices 
          will be assessed for improved accuracy; 
          perhaps the bands used by Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope NDCI products are not enough for Iowa waters.This conclusion was reached when I simply could not determine 
          why this approach failed miserably in action. Out of pure curiosity, I ran a few other indices with Sentinel-2 and was able to constrain the impact of clouds better(Figure 10). 
          In particular, I completed (Eq.2), and demonstrated substantial improvement from Sentinel-2 (Figure 11), although a statistically 
          significant relationship is still not present.
          However, it's important to note that PlanetScope and Sentinel-3 do not have the proper bands to complete this calculation and are therefore not shown.  </p>

  <h6 style="text-indent: 50px;"><i>Interactability improvements:</i></h6>
  <p style="text-indent: 50px;">	Currently, this project and its related imagery is not interactable, and this will be addressed in the future. 
    First, it would be very handy to have the three satellite images stacked on one another with the ability to switch between them easily or adjust 
    a slider to increase/decrease the opacity to compare rasters 1-1. Including this would only increase in value when other indices are added, which 
    could easily be added as several SVG files for each instrument that a dropdown list could call. Secondly, if we were to show each of the rasters 
    (in order PlanetScope, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-3) in a 1x3 grid, it would be very handy to lock the extent of each grid for each instrument and add 
    panning and zooming capabilities for the imagery. This would allow the user to zoom into the imagery and simultaneously see subtle details across all 
    three images and better show the differences between spatial resolution of instruments - it is very easy to see the difference for Sentinel-3, but it 
    is hard to see at this scale for Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope. Third, a temporal assessment must also be included in the future, where you can compare 
    imagery throughout a timeframe the user selects. Adding the temporal component would substantially improve the tool towards the LOQATE lab's goal of 
    making a HAB dashboard with which water quality managers can interact. 
    Fourth, other interpolation/smoothing methods should be available, such as kriging, bilinear interpolation, and nearest neighbor. 
    Finally, the user should be able to select between various classifications of 
    the raster data, which is not included in this project. While general interactability would be a nice improvement, 
    the addition of classification schemes is necessary for moving forward and will be included in the future. </p>
  <h6 style="text-indent: 50px;"><i>Conclusion:</i></h6>
  <p style="text-indent: 50px;">	The primary learning outcome of this work is that chlorophyll-a indices, while computationally quick, will not be the answer 
    for remotely sensing chlorophyll-a in Iowa's optically complex waters. In comparing the IDW and NDCI products, there is no clear winner for capturing the 
    spatial dynamics of HABs reliably. Certainly, the higher spatial resolution instruments capture more details of HABs themselves. However, given the NDCI 
    methodology, the resulting visual comparison may not be meaningless if the NDCI product is not statistically significant with verified chlorophyll-a values. 
    Therefore, it is essential to shift our future assessment to rely more on spectral resolution improvements over spatial resolution improvements. Sentinel-3 
    demonstrates this as it performed the best across Big Spirit Lake considering all platforms and will be the satellite that LOQATE places the greatest emphasis 
    on moving forward with 2024 sampling, even though it is the hardest imagery to pre-process. Finally, what is clear from Sentinel-2 imagery is that clouds 
    substantially affect the calculation, and a masking product must be developed in the future. The primary limitation of this work is that it does not assess other 
    spectral indices besides NDCI (yes, a quick foray into a different one was included, but this is nowhere near the scrutiny needed to include the work in results), 
    as other bands may be necessary for retrieval of chlorophyll-a. 
    However, I postulate that Iowa waters are optically complex, more so than any index can reliably capture.  </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">	Therefore, what must change moving into the future is the inclusion of machine learning approaches over indices. 
      In recent years, researchers have called for increased empirical, machine learning-driven remote sensing approaches for inland water quality assessment, 
      as these techniques performed better than spectral indices in retrieving optically active constituents such as chlorophyll-a and phycocyanin (Sagan et al., 2020). 
      However, predicting microcystin concentrations with remote sensing remains a challenge because it is not optically active. Machine learning approaches, such as 
      random forest and multiple-instance learning algorithms, could link the complex, non-linear relationships between chlorophyll-a, phycocyanin, and microcystin. 
      For example, Sagan et al. (2020) used a deep neural network fusion approach with Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 to increase the revisit time and predict HABs in 
      Missouri and Illinois lakes with an  of 0.85. Beal et al. (2024) found that random forest using Sentinel-2 predicted chlorophyll-a, phycocyanin, and dissolved 
      oxygen with an of 0.47, 0.69, and 0.68, respectively. Furthermore, LOQATE lab PI, Dr. Susan Meerdink, has developed a mutli-target multiple-instance machine 
      learning approach to help our work better capture algal bloom dynamics. While not implemented for HABs yet, the multi-target multiple-instance approach has 
      proven to be a very computationally efficient and accurate machine-learning approach for detecting invasive plant species at low concentrations with imprecise 
      location data (Meerdink et al., 2024). Using hyperspectral imagery over the Great Lakes, the multi-target multiple-instance approach appears to track trends of 
      HAB density. Although in-situ data is not available to validate the Great Lakes MTMI approach, 
      preliminary results from these approaches are encouraging, especially for the optical complexity of inland, freshwater lakes such as Big Spirit.  </p>
