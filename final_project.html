      <br>
      <p>Harmful algal blooms (HABs) have been increasingly present in Iowa lakes, 
        which in turn threatens drinking water availability and state income through recreational opportunities. 
        Given that HABs can produce microcystin, a toxin that can cause liver and kidney failure and cancer, there 
        is an increased human health risk (Gu et al., 2022; US EPA, 2013). Current projections suggest that HAB
        events will increase with warming temperatures, and 2023 was a record-breaking year for HAB advisories in Iowa 
        (Gu et al., 2022; US EPA, 2013). Currently, in Iowa, 39 state-owned beaches are monitored by water sampling once a week, 
        limiting the capacity to make informed risk assessments across the state throughout the summer. 
        Environmental groups have stated that increased monitoring is needed to limit human exposure (IDNR, 2022; Peikes, 2021; Schechinger, 2021), 
        but budget constraints limit the ability to increase monitoring across more lakes. 
        There is a critical need to lower costs and time while improving our capacity for detecting and managing HAB dynamics across time and space.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Satellite remote sensing has been leveraged worldwide for rapid HAB assessment,
           capturing HAB spatial and temporal variability at a rate that is impossible with in-situ techniques. 
           Furthermore, the annual mean cost savings of a satellite platform for retrieval of chlorophyll-a alone 
           has been estimated to be $42 million a year (Papenfus et al., 2020). However, current work targets large 
           freshwater lakes (e.g., Lake Erie) or oceans (e.g., Florida coast), which is not translatable to the smaller 
           freshwater lakes common in Iowa and the Midwest because of the need to capture near-shore HABs 
           (Binding et al., 2021; Hill et al., 2020). Inland waters are also optically complex systems in comparison to 
           coastal and ocean monitoring, making established techniques non-transferable. This research expands the use of 
           satellite remote sensing for detecting, assessing, and monitoring HABs in freshwater inland lakes with a focus 
           on generating a near-daily product that could inform public health initiatives. We will develop a remote sensing 
           methodology that fuses imagery from multiple satellite sensors, enhancing our capability to monitor HABs almost 
           daily across a lake. This multi-sensor approach equips Iowa water managers with the spatio-temporal trends that 
           can provide insight into the dynamics of HABs. However, to complete this overarching aim in future research, 
          we must first assess the capacities of a suite of satellites in retrieving chlorophyll-a. </p>
          <p style="text-indent: 50px;"><b>Here, I use satellite remote sensing to predict chlorophyll-a in Big Spirit Lake 
            in Iowa with PlanetScope, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-3 for a 9/11/2023 to answer the following questions:</b></p>
            <ol>
              <li>What spatial/spectral resolution of the proposed instruments is most appropriate for capturing the spatial variability of HABS?</li>
              <li>Which instrument has the highest pixel and interpolated pixel correlation between field-verified chlorophyll-a and remotely sensed chlorophyll-a?</li>
            </ol>

            <p class="card-text text-center">(Figure 1. Study sample locations are on Big Spirit Lake, Iowa. 
              The chlorophyll-a value is shown using a graduated symbol approach with a Jenks-natural breaks classification. 
              These points and values were used to create the inverse distance-weighted product.)</p>
       </div>
      </div><br>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px;">The study site for this project is Big Spirit Lake, located in Orleans in northwest Iowa. 
        Big Spirit Lake was selected as it is the largest body of water in the state of Iowa and is a major 
        recreation site for Iowans that also experience late summer algal blooms. 
        The presence of microcystin is the main concern for public health, but microcystin does not possess 
        a spectral or optical signature that remote sensing can measure. Therefore, proxies such as chlorophyll-a 
        and phycocyanin are used to monitor microcystin concentrations, as they have been shown to correlate with 
        microcystin toxin presence (Buley et al., 2022; Marion et al., 2012). Chlorophyll-a is a pigment in algae that
        photosynthesizes sunlight into organic compounds and is a commonly applied measure of water's eutrophic condition as 
        algae biomass grows (Zhang et al., 2017). However, chlorophyll-a is not a perfect measure of HAB risk, as it is present
         in many algal species that do not produce toxins (Ogashawara, 2020). Phycocyanin, a secondary pigment 
         found in HAB species such as Microcystin aeruginosa, has been the target for many recent studies as it 
         provides the capacity to distinguish toxin-producing algal species. </p>
         <p style="text-indent: 50px;">We conducted four field campaigns 
          in Big Spirit lake through the 2023 season to gather the in-situ chlorophyll-a lab-verified values needed 
          for future empirically-driven machine-learning approaches. Data assessed here is from campaign four on 9/11/2023.
           Each campaign used a small boat to collect 40 water samples following State Hygenic Lab (SHL) protocol. 
           Study site sampling points are approximately 700 meters from one another and were created to align with 
           the raster pixels of overpassing satellites (Figure 1). At each collection site, sub-centimeter resolution Global navigation 
           satellite system (GNSS) locations were taken with a Trimble DA2 at each site to identify corresponding imagery pixels. 
           The in-situ values collected on 9/11/2023 had chlorophyll-a values verified via the SHL. 
         These values will be point-based data used to verify pixel values from the remotely sensed data. 
         These pixel point values were also used to generate an Inverse Distance-Weighted (IDW) raster in ArcGIS Pro &copy;ESRI. 
         The IDW product has a pixel size equal to the platform its compared against 
         (PlanetScope: IDW 3m, Sentinel-2: IDW 20m, Sentinel-3: IDW 300m) for a fair comparison of in-situ predicted to remotely sensed HAB distribution.   </p>

            <p class="card-text text-center">(Figure 2. In Sept. 2023, Big Spirit Lake in NW Iowa had a HAB that was imaged with PlanetScope (~3m pixel size),

              Inset shows Orleans Beach. While daily imagery is critical for monitoring, Sentinel-3 limits the ability to capture near-shore HABs.)</p>
       </div>
      </div><br>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Three sensors are used in this project, as they have varying spatial resolutions and band placements.
        Sentinel-2, with a revisit time of 5 days and spatial resolution of 20 meters, has been used in recent HAB analysis (Beal et al., 2024). 
        Sentinel-3 was designed for water applications, but specifically for ocean watercolor, so it collects imagery approximately daily but with 
        300 m spatial resolution (Donlon et al., 2012). The PlanetScope SuperDove satellite constellation has a nearly daily revisit time and a 
        spatial resolution of 3 m but remains untested as data has only recently become available to the public. These remote sensing platforms were 
        selected for their synergistic capabilities: Sentinel-2's moderate spatial resolution and more appropriate spectral bands, Sentinel-3's 
        frequent revisits and ideal spectral bands, and PlanetScope's high spatial and temporal resolution (Figure 2). 
        Sentinel data is freely available from the <a href="https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/">Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem</a>&copy;, 
        and PlanetScope data from <a href="https://www.planet.com/explorer/">Planet Explorer</a>&copy;.</p>

      <h6 style="text-indent: 50px;"><i>Predicting Chlorophyll-a:</i></h6>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px;">In the future, we plan on assessing more spectral indices, a multiple-instance learning algorithm, 
        and a random forest machine learning approach. However, this project assesses the Normalized Difference Chlorophyll Index (NDCI). 
        The NDCI uses the red-edge (centered 705 nm, 15nm Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM)) and red (centered 665nm, 30 nm FWHM)  bands 
        available on the Sentinel-2 (Eq. 1), as these bands have been shown to strongly correlate to chlorophyll-a (Caballero et al., 2020). 
        Planetscope has spectrally coincident bands, both in location and bandwidth, allowing for a 1-1 comparison of the resulting NDCI product. 
        However, Sentinel-3 uses bands 08 (centered 665 nm, 10nm FWHM) and 11 (centered 708.75 nm, 10nm FWHM) to produce the resulting NDCI product.
        The resulting product values can only exist on a scale from -1 to positive 1, where positive values demonstrate increasing chlorophyll-a abundance;
         however, extremely high and low values can also indicate clouds and cloud shadows. </p>

      <h6 style="text-indent: 50px;"><i>Targeted Audience, Visualization Objectives, & Workflow:</i></h6>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Eventually, this work will be used to build a HAB dashboard for the State of Iowa, 
        which will alleviate the demand upon agencies to increase water quality testing without increasing spending. 
        Therefore, the ultimate audience is water quality managers in Iowa. However, established satellite remote sensing methodologies, 
        such as using NDCI to measure current water quality, have yet to be tested in Iowa. To build this eventual HAB dashboard, 
        we must first determine what available instruments will be most helpful in achieving our ultimate goal. 
        This project aims to resolve this by answering research questions 1 and 2, which ultimately makes the audience of this research 
        the members of the Lab for Observing and Quantifying Aquatic and Terrestrial Ecosystems (LOQATE). 
        The LOQATE lab needs this first step completed before any further research can commence. </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px;">The primary visualization objective of this work is to compare the distributions of remotely sensed 
        HAB products to an in-situ point-based IDW product. The rationale behind this decision is to clarify the underlying remotely sensed data 
        if poor correlations are present; ergo, if NDCI performs poorly, having a visual distribution comparison helps us understand where 
        performance is low and gives insights into why. Furthermore, it also allows general comparisons to be made given the inherent temporal 
        limitation of this research; a remotely sensed image is a snapshot of the whole-lake water quality conditions, while the in-situ point 
        data is collected for two to three hours via boat. If visual comparisons of the 
        IDW and remotely sensed chlorophyll-a disagree/make visual sense, that may provide valuable information regarding sampling methodology.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">The ultimate coding objective is determining the most successful chlorophyll-a retrieval from satellite 
          remote-sensing products. Answering research question two is accomplished in two ways: pulling the NDCI value from the nearest pixel 
          to the in-situ point data and interpolating a value from all pixels near the point-based data. Ultimately, two heavily refactored programs 
          from seven original programs were developed to complete this project's methodology and workflow and answer the research questions (Figure 3). 
          A secondary objective in the figures generated by this work was to make the scales comparable between the varying IDW and remote sensing products; 
          therefore, a function was developed to normalize all products for all resulting figures.</p>
