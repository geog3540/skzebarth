      <br>
      <p>Harmful algal blooms (HABs) have been increasingly present in Iowa lakes, 
        which in turn threatens drinking water availability and state income through recreational opportunities. 
        Given that HABs can produce microcystin, a toxin that can cause liver and kidney failure and cancer, there 
        is an increased human health risk (Gu et al., 2022; US EPA, 2013). Current projections suggest that HAB
        events will increase with warming temperatures, and 2023 was a record-breaking year for HAB advisories in Iowa 
        (Gu et al., 2022; US EPA, 2013). Currently, in Iowa, 39 state-owned beaches are monitored by water sampling once a week, 
        limiting the capacity to make informed risk assessments across the state throughout the summer. 
        Environmental groups have stated that increased monitoring is needed to limit human exposure (IDNR, 2022; Peikes, 2021; Schechinger, 2021), 
        but budget constraints limit the ability to increase monitoring across more lakes. 
        There is a critical need to lower costs and time while improving our capacity for detecting and managing HAB dynamics across time and space.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Satellite remote sensing has been leveraged worldwide for rapid HAB assessment,
           capturing HAB spatial and temporal variability at a rate that is impossible with in-situ techniques. 
           Furthermore, the annual mean cost savings of a satellite platform for retrieval of chlorophyll-a alone 
           has been estimated to be $42 million a year (Papenfus et al., 2020). However, current work targets large 
           freshwater lakes (e.g., Lake Erie) or oceans (e.g., Florida coast), which is not translatable to the smaller 
           freshwater lakes common in Iowa and the Midwest because of the need to capture near-shore HABs 
           (Binding et al., 2021; Hill et al., 2020). Inland waters are also optically complex systems in comparison to 
           coastal and ocean monitoring, making established techniques non-transferable. This research expands the use of 
           satellite remote sensing for detecting, assessing, and monitoring HABs in freshwater inland lakes with a focus 
           on generating a near-daily product that could inform public health initiatives. We will develop a remote sensing 
           methodology that fuses imagery from multiple satellite sensors, enhancing our capability to monitor HABs almost 
           daily across a lake. This multi-sensor approach equips Iowa water managers with the spatio-temporal trends that 
           can provide insight into the dynamics of HABs. However, to complete this overarching aim in future research, 
          we must first assess the capacities of a suite of satellites in retrieving chlorophyll-a. </p>
          <p style="text-indent: 50px;"><b>Here, I use satellite remote sensing to predict chlorophyll-a in Big Spirit Lake 
            in Iowa with PlanetScope, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-3 for a 9/11/2023 to answer the following questions:</b></p>
            <ol>
              <li>What spatial/spectral resolution of the proposed instruments is most appropriate for capturing the spatial variability of HABS?</li>
              <li>Which instrument has the highest pixel and interpolated pixel correlation between field-verified chlorophyll-a and remotely sensed chlorophyll-a?</li>
            </ol>

            <p class="card-text text-center">(Figure 1. Study sample locations are on Big Spirit Lake, Iowa. 
              The chlorophyll-a value is shown using a graduated symbol approach with a Jenks-natural breaks classification. 
              These points and values were used to create the inverse distance-weighted product.)</p>
       </div>
      </div><br>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px;">The study site for this project is Big Spirit Lake, located in Orleans in northwest Iowa. 
        Big Spirit Lake was selected as it is the largest body of water in the state of Iowa and is a major 
        recreation site for Iowans that also experience late summer algal blooms. 
        The presence of microcystin is the main concern for public health, but microcystin does not possess 
        a spectral or optical signature that remote sensing can measure. Therefore, proxies such as chlorophyll-a 
        and phycocyanin are used to monitor microcystin concentrations, as they have been shown to correlate with 
        microcystin toxin presence (Buley et al., 2022; Marion et al., 2012). Chlorophyll-a is a pigment in algae that
        photosynthesizes sunlight into organic compounds and is a commonly applied measure of water's eutrophic condition as 
        algae biomass grows (Zhang et al., 2017). However, chlorophyll-a is not a perfect measure of HAB risk, as it is present
         in many algal species that do not produce toxins (Ogashawara, 2020). Phycocyanin, a secondary pigment 
         found in HAB species such as Microcystin aeruginosa, has been the target for many recent studies as it 
         provides the capacity to distinguish toxin-producing algal species. We conducted four field campaigns 
         in Big Spirit lake through the 2023 season to gather the in-situ chlorophyll-a lab-verified values needed 
         for future empirically-driven machine-learning approaches. Data assessed here is from campaign four on 9/11/2023.
          Each campaign used a small boat to collect 40 water samples following State Hygenic Lab (SHL) protocol. 
          Study site sampling points are approximately 700 meters from one another and were created to align with 
          the raster pixels of overpassing satellites (Figure 1). At each collection site, sub-centimeter resolution Global navigation 
          satellite system (GNSS) locations were taken with a Trimble DA2 at each site to identify corresponding imagery pixels. 
          The in-situ values collected on 9/11/2023 had chlorophyll-a values verified via the SHL. 
        These values will be point-based data used to verify pixel values from the remotely sensed data. </p>

              Inset shows Orleans Beach. While daily imagery is critical for monitoring, Sentinel-3 limits the ability to capture near-shore HABs.)</p>

      </div><br>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Three sensors are used in this project, as they have varying spatial resolutions and band placements.
        Sentinel-2, with a revisit time of 5 days and spatial resolution of 20 meters, has been used in recent HAB analysis (Beal et al., 2024). 
        Sentinel-3 was designed for water applications, but specifically for ocean watercolor, so it collects imagery approximately daily but with 
        300 m spatial resolution (Donlon et al., 2012). The PlanetScope SuperDove satellite constellation has a nearly daily revisit time and a 
        spatial resolution of 3 m but remains untested as data has only recently become available to the public. These remote sensing platforms were 
        selected for their synergistic capabilities: Sentinel-2's moderate spatial resolution and more appropriate spectral bands, Sentinel-3's 
        frequent revisits and ideal spectral bands, and PlanetScope's high spatial and temporal resolution (Figure 2). 
        Sentinel data is freely available from the <a href="https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/">Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem</a>&copy;, 
        and PlanetScope data from <a href="https://www.planet.com/explorer/">Planet Explorer</a>&copy;.</p>

      <h6 style="text-indent: 50px;"><i>Predicting Chlorophyll-a:</i></h6>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px;">In the future, we plan on assessing more spectral indices, a multiple-instance learning algorithm, 
        and a random forest machine learning approach. However, this project assesses the Normalized Difference Chlorophyll Index (NDCI). 
        The NDCI uses the red-edge (centered 705 nm, 15nm Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM)) and red (centered 665nm, 30 nm FWHM)  bands 
        available on the Sentinel-2 (Eq. 1), as these bands have been shown to strongly correlate to chlorophyll-a (Caballero et al., 2020). 
        Planetscope has spectrally coincident bands, both in location and bandwidth, allowing for a 1-1 comparison of the resulting NDCI product. 
        However, Sentinel-3 uses bands 08 (centered 665 nm, 10nm FWHM) and 11 (centered 708.75 nm, 10nm FWHM) to produce the resulting NDCI product.   </p>

        <h6>Justification of Chloropleth Map:</h6>
      <p>To begin, we are dealing with a non-normal dataset, which is expected given that we are measuring human movement through time. 
        Therefore, the classification schemes that should be used are natural breaks and manual breaks. 
        While natural breaks is better at minimizing the variance within the class and maximizing the variance between classes, 
        I personally did not like that it would group positive and negative values into classes around zero (Figure 2, class 4 of legend). 
        Therefore, I opted to use manual breaks with selections close to the natural break locations. You can see that this changes the map readers understanding
         of migration for a few states that experienced an increase in flow but would not have appeared this way with natural breaks 
         (Figure 1, Figure 2; Minnesota, Ohio, Nevada, some eastern seaboard states). The diverging color scheme was selected as this is a diverging dataset with a
          meaningful zero; one could argue that the zero is significant as it shows no change in population, but I argue it is also important as the boundary between 
          loss and gain and is therefore essential to distinguish in the manual breaks choice. 
        The blue-red color map was used as the most visually appealing, with red indicating a net loss and blue indicating a net gain.  </p>

      <h6>Justification of Nodes:</h6>
      <p>When observing the underlying total flow data for the nodes, we are dealing with a similar non-normal dataset, however, no negative values.
         While several classification choices could be used, particularly some that are more accurate to the underlying data (natural breaks), 
         I ultimately decided on a proportional scale with a monotone color. What I ultimately took away from the readings for this assignment is that color and classes are powerful tools, 
         which limits how much you can use on a single map with multiple visual aspects. The color comes from the underlying choropleth map, 
         and using color here would only confuse the reader further or require them to put more effort into understanding the map story. Based on the research, 
         the monotone coloring will lead to the most straightforward interpretation of total movement. I tried a custom coloration of white to white, but it was not as clean as an "all black" color scheme. 
         Secondly, the proportional scale had the lowest number of classes, and when I used other classification methods, such as natural breaks with a minimum of four class sizes, 
         this only added to the visual clutter. Even though there may be a better classification scheme given the data, such as a three-class manual breaks approach, 
        in this particular case, the proportional does its job quite well WHILE allowing the reader to compare state to state.  </p><br>

              <p class="card-text text-center">(Figure 3. 3 US Migration Map, Reduced Flows)</p>
         </div>
               </div><br>

      <h6> Justification of Flows:</h6>
      <p>In the same vein as the previous justifications, we have non-normal data, and I used manual breaks. 
        I did this to lower the class sizes to three; yes, 4 - 7 would generally be better, but it helps show the story of movement while reducing clutter. 
        First, differentiating between large movements and small movements is substantially more straightforward. 
        Following the research again, using the monotone arrow and tapered flow line produced the most correct and quickest response from the assessed users, and I applied the same knowledge here.
         While a tapered flowline was "okay" at getting flow across, the arrowhead was simply better at telling the story of directionality.
          Secondly, it does this without using color, which is already present in the underlying choropleth map. 
          The color being a part of flows a vital takeaway from the assignment papers, and what was clear is that flows with color can be highly distracting. 
          Therefore, I chose to avoid the colored flow approach entirely. 
          Finally, The instructions ask for us to "Try to limit the visual clutter produced by overlapping flow lines by carefully adjusting the show top flows option on Flow Symbology." 
          The largest overlap of flows, or greatest clutter, occurs in Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Texas. 
          However, I argue that reducing the flows beyond its current setting (100) doesn't impact the cluttered area, and more importantly, 
          once top flows are reduced to the point it does affect these states (~70) it has severely impacted the story of movement in the states. 
          Yes, it may be more visually appealing (Figure 3), but it throws away the story of movement in several states and skews the story of human movement compared to the more cluttered but accurate map (Figure 1). 
        Therefore, I am keeping the more cluttered flows with its limited classes instead. </p>
